# ATF A&D Bound Book
This is a SQL Database for recording firearms aquisition and disposition information, commonly referred to as the bound book.



While the intention of this project is to make a compliant solution, this project makes no claims regarding its compliance. Use at your own risk and ideally consult a lawyer specializing in FFL compliance regardless of what solution you choose to manage your bound book. 


# Goals for this project:

-Prevent duplicate aquisitions

-Prevent disposition of assets yet to be aquired

-Prevent problems with aquiring multiple NSN firearms by using serial and aquisition date and time as the primary key

-Provide an easy way to determine when ATF form 3310 must be submitted

-Provide automated logging of who and why manual changes were made per ATF regulations regarding electronic bound books
